This project demonstrates the core structure of an online store without relying on JavaScript. It includes a responsive design that adapts to different devices, smooth navigation across sections and pages, a search bar that jumps to categories, product listings with detail pages, and a styled checkout form. Even though the interactive functionality is limited, the layout and styling replicate the look and flow of a real e-commerce site.
